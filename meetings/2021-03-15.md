# Meeting Minutes 

## Action Item Review
- Jane still making last few changes to the blog post; it's almost done and ready for review and publishing.
- Jane created tracking issues for low-priority tasks that have been sitting around for a while.
- Charles has been working on the book diagram, which is coming along nicely.
- Sean has no progress to report on book examples since the last meeting.
- Jakub and Jane figured out the `rust-sv` crate error.
- Jakub work's work on the termination trait stabilization is going well.
- Jane created a zulip topic to discuss 3rd party libraries that ought to go in the book with the libs/lang teams.
- Oliver has been triaging potential issues that have been coming in.

## Triaging Issues
- (low priority) https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80846
    - Issue on differences between `std::panic!` and `core::panic!` behavior.
    - This is an edge case that most people won't encounter as it's being addressed by the 2021 edition.
    - Would be more worthwhile to spend time on getting `dyn Error` integrated with panics.
- (out of scope) https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/syntax-for-returning-early-with-an-error/14181
    - Forum thread on `try` syntax, which is a lang team concern; this is explicitly out-of-scope for this working group.
- (out of scope, superceded by try trait v2) https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/specialization.3A.20exclude.20traits.20or.20types/near/229141547
    - Thread about negative trait bounds, which probably won't play well with the trait solving engine, as it would make trait resolution an undecidable problem; the lang team is working on specialization instead.
    - Overlap of `From` impls for catch-all error types is already potentially handled by the new `Try` trait RFC, which makes it possible to handle the `From` impl as part of the `Try` type that wraps the catch-all error.
- https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/146212-t-compiler.2Fconst-eval/topic/static_assert.20for.20const.20generics/near/229109938
    - This is a diagnostic issue with the compiler; left up to the compiler team as to whether they'd like the error handling group to help out with this.
