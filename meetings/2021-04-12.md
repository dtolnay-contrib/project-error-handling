# Meeting Minutes (Jane)

## Action Items Review

- blog post is currently waiting on feedback from Niko, meeting scheduled to discuss it on Friday, will probably need another revision after that conversation.
- Error diagram for book is coming along
- Termination trait has run into issues with specialization, also need to answer questions about the underlying representation.
- backtrace in core is having issues with lang items not being recognized, even for the initial PoC impl
- Generic member access RFC update is in progress, splitting type tagged downcasting into it's own RFC

## Issue Triage

- Why doesn't NoneError impl Error?
    - need to review the thread, but general feeling is NoneError isn't representitive of an actual error and so shouldn't exist
    - added to project board to track the issue
- automatic filtering of query machinery out of backtraces
    - Looks awesome, no involvement needed from PG-Error-Handling
- Essay on checked exceptions
    - Nice user story, will keep monitoring but no action needed from PG-Error-Handling
